# What is Brain Tumor?
* A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. 
* There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign tumors. 
* Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors. 
* All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. 
* These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes. 
* The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. 
* Other symptoms may include difficulty walking, speaking or with sensations. As the disease progresses, unconsciousness may occur.

# Objective 
* The main Objective of this project is to use the CNN model and then classify whether a particular MRI scan has a tumor or not.
* Since the tumor is very difficult to be seen via naked eyes. 
* But with the help of New Technology we can build and train a CNN model would be an easy solution to identify if the patient suffers from a brain tumor or not.

# Dataset

* I have used the dataset available on kaggle
* It has 198 images as training set and 58 images as test sets.
* The dataset folder has been divided into training and test set folders which is further divided into yes or no folders.
